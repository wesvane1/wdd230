1) Suppliment words with visuals

2) Make the page readable, 50-60 charactors per line (centered looks good sometimes)

3) Too many fonts, stick to one, two, or three. Use different weights instead of new fonts. Bold and italics
go a long way

4) Ineffective color combinations are a quick way to loose clients. Use combinations that make your webpage
easy to read and something that can catch the readers eye.

5) Impliment lots of negative space, too little negative space can actually strain the clients eye and make the
experience much less enjoyable. USE WHITE SPACE! Look to google.com for a good example.

6) Align elements correctly, grids are a great way of helping with this.

7) Contrast is your friend. DO NOT use light text on a light background. Use dark colors on light backgrounds.
or use light text over a dark background.

8) When used correctly, scaling of text or images can guide the client to another part of the page.

9) Make sure that the fonts match the message of the page.

10) Line breaks should have purpose, like sepereation between a header and a paragraph

11) ALWAYS use high quality images. NEVER scale up.

12) STAY CONSISTENT, use fonts correctly, colors correctly etc.
