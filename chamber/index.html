  <header>
    <!-- The header must contain a logo, site name, and navigation (nav), spanning the entire screen in the large view.
    You may elect to limit the content width within the header.  -->
    <!-- The header also displays the current date using JavaScript in this format: Wednesday, 24 July 2020 -->
    <nav>
      <!-- The navigation contains four page links and two social media external links.
      The navigation menu starts with a 'hamburger' button in the small and medium 
      views and is visible in the larger view. The menu must be responsive and use 
      JavaScript to respond to user behavior and toggle between not showing any menu 
      items and showing all the menu items. -->

  <main>
    <!-- The main section will not be built at this stage of the project but placeholder blocks and general
    layout should be started. The illustrations provide the sections that are required and where they
    are to be placed in the respective view sizes. The sections include hero image and call to action,
    news, event(s), weather, join, and two to three company spotlights. -->
  </main>

  <footer>
    <!-- The footer contains the logo (a placeholder icon/image is fine for now), contact information,
    a link to a map, and a base footer with a dynamic copyright year (driven by JavaScript), site name,
    your name, "WDD 230 Project", and the last modification date driven by JavaScript. -->
